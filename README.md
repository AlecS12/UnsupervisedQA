# UnsupervisedQA

Code, Data and models supporting the experiments in the ACL 2019 Paper: [Unsupervised Question Answering by Cloze Translation](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/UnsupervisedQA/unsupervised_question_answering_by_cloze_translation.pdf). 

Obtaining training data for Question Answering (QA) is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and existing QA datasets are only available for limited domains and languages. In this work, we take some of the first steps towards unsupervised QA, and develop an approach that, *without using the SQuAD training data at all*, achieves 56.4 F1 on SQuAD v1.1, and 64.5 F1 when the answer is a named entity mention.

This repository provides code to run pre-trained models to generate sythetic question answering question data. We also make a very large synthetic training dataset for extractive question answering available.

**_NOTE:_**  The data is available for download now, the code is coming soon!

## Dataset Downloads

We make available a dataset of 5 million SQuAD-like question answering datapoints, automatically generated by the unsupervised system described in the system.

The data can be downloaded [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/UnsupervisedQA/UnsupervisedQAData.tar.gz).
The data is in the SQuAD v1 format, and contains:


| Fold | # Paragraphs | # QA pairs |
| :----------------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | 
| `unsupervised_qa_train.json` | 782,556 | 3,915,498 |
| `unsupervised_qa_dev.json`  | 1,000 | 4,795 |
| `unsupervised_qa_test.json` | 1,000 | 4,804 |

Using this training data to fine-tune BERT-Large for reading comprehension, you should be able to achieve over 50.0 F1 on the SQuAD V1.1 development set.
 

## Models and Code

Pre-trained models and the code to run them are coming soon.
