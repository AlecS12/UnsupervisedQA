This repository provides code to run pre-trained models to generate sythetic question answering question data. We also make a very large synthetic training dataset for extractive question answering available.

## Dataset Downloads

We make available a dataset of 5 million SQuAD-like question answering datapoints, automatically generated by the unsupervised system described in the system.

The data can be downloaded [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/UnsupervisedQA/UnsupervisedQAData.tar.gz).
The data is in the SQuAD v1 format, and contains:


| Fold | # Paragraphs | # QA pairs |
| :----------------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | 
| `unsupervised_qa_train.json` | 782,556 | 3,915,498 |
| `unsupervised_qa_dev.json`  | 1,000 | 4,795 |
| `unsupervised_qa_test.json` | 1,000 | 4,804 |

Using this training data to fine-tune BERT-Large for reading comprehension, you should be able to achieve over 50.0 F1 on the SQuAD V1.1 development set.
 

## Models and Code

Pre-trained models and the code to run them are coming soon.
